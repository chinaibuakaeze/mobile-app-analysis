    "The overall impression for the free English android apps is different from the free English ios apps. There's no one dominant genre consisiting of more than 50% as there is in the ios apps. Also most of the apps are designed for more practical purposes(e.g family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity) unlike the ios apps. This is also higlighted in the frquency table below showing the genres column with andorid apps dataset. The difference between the category and the genres columns in android apps is not clear at the moment. However, the genres column appears more detailed, but since I'm looking for the big picture I'll focus on the category column moving forward."

    "Social networking apps seem popular but that is because of dominance of apps like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest etc. The same is true for the reference genre where reviews are dominated by apps like the bible, dictonary etc. If these popular apps are eliminated from the list, the user reviews for these genres would be much smaller than they are currently. Since I'm only focusing on the high level analysis, I won't be separating out these popular apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fun and games section have the most reviews in general. In my earlier analysis, the fun and games(games, entertainment, photo & video and social networking) had the most supply of apps too, and this could mean a market saturation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other interesting categories that seem popular among users are: weather, travel, food & drink, book, and finance. The weather genre would not be suitable because people don't spend a lot of time on weather apps so it would be difficult to generate in-app adds. Travel wouldn't work  for what we're looking for becuase it would require us to integrate with APIs from hotels and airlines and this would make the app non-free. Finance, especially personal finance sounds really interesting and I would have picked it as the recommmendation especially because of how popular it is with users, but it requires domain knowledge and the company isn't looking to hire a finance expert. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining popular categories are Food & Drink and Book. Only 0.4% of apps on the app store fall under the book category and 0.8% fall under the food & drink category. If we go with the book or food & drinks category, then there would definitely be room for the company's app to stand out among other apps.\n",

    "The communication genre seems to be the most popular with over 38 million installs, followed by video player with over 24 million, social with over 23 million and photography with over 17 million installs. The communication genere are dominated by a few popular apps(Gmail, hangouts, skype, Messenger). This also applies to the video player and photography genres. The companies that dominate these categories are very difficult to compete against so I'll be moving on to other categories to explore further what could work best in our situation. \n",

    "Other popular categories include: entertainment, games,productivity, tools, shopping and travel. I determined earlier that there seems to be a market saturation in the fun/entertainment and games categoory so I wouldn't be recommending these categories. Other popular apps with over 1 million installs include: business, education, finance, art & design, food & drinks, health & fitness, lifestyle and family. My recommendation here is to go with the food & drink genre and make a content based app on different receipes for food, snacks and drinks becasue we're looking for apps that can work for both the google and apple markets. Also, there's a vast idea of contents that can be created in this genre, plus a huge room for generating revenue through ads in this genre. It is important to note that only 1.2 percent of apps available in the google play store are in the food & drink niche so there's definitely room for the company's app to standout amongst other apps in the market."
